# OpenSeismoMatlab
Open source software for strong ground motion data processing

OpenSeismoMatlab can calculate the following strong motion data processing output: 
(1) Time histories of acceleration, velocity and displacement, with or without baseline correction, 
(2) Resampled time histories of acceleration, velocity and displacement with modified time step size, 
(3) Peak ground acceleration, velocity and displacement (PGA, PGV, PGD), 
(4) Total cumulative energy and its normalized time history, 
(5) Significant duration according to Trifunac & Brady (1975), 
(6) Arias intensity, 
(7) Linear elastic response spectra, 
(8) Constant ductility inelastic response spectra, 
(9) Fourier amplitude spectrum, 
(10) Mean period (Tm)
