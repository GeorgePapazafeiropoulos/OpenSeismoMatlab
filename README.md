# OpenSeismoMatlab
Open source software for strong ground motion data processing

OpenSeismoMatlab can calculate the following strong motion data processing output: 
1) Peak ground acceleration
2) Peak ground velocity
3) Peak ground displacement
4) Total cumulative energy and normalized cumulative energy vs time
5) Significant duration D_5_95 according to Trifunac & Brady (1975)
6) Significant duration D_5_75
7) Total Arias intensity (Ia)
8) Velocity time history (with baseline correction or not)
9) Displacement time history (with baseline correction or not)
10) Resampled acceleration time history (i.e. the input acceleration time history with modified time step size)
11) Linear elastic pseudo-acceleration response spectrum
12) Linear elastic pseudo-velocity response spectrum
13) Linear elastic displacement response spectrum
14) Linear elastic velocity response spectrum
15) Linear elastic acceleration response spectrum
16) Constant ductility displacement response spectrum
17) Constant ductility velocity response spectrum
18) Constant ductility acceleration response spectrum
19) Fourier amplitude spectrum
20) Mean period (Tm)
21) Lowpass Butterworth-filtered acceleration time history
22) Highpass Butterworth-filtered acceleration time history
23) Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) of SDOF system excited with the input acceleration time history
